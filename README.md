# The Boca Ciega High School JROTC Website

http://explouad.github.io or http://theministry.ntdll.net/tests (I recommend the first)
# Author(s)

This was home grown with love by the lovely BCHS JROTC S-6. (I'm tearing up a bit)

# Usage

Please, please, PLEASE give credit back to this if you decide to template off it or copy it verbatum. As said in the licence, I do not care what you do with it, as long as credit is given where it is due.

# Libraries

I use Bootstrap for basically everything in here. If you see a bunch of junk files, it's because I'm experimenting and want to add some variety. Less and Sass will probably be used in the near future.

# Credit

Yes, I did get some code snippets from sites. But most of this is me, and me basing things off of those snippets and trying to be original. If you're saying "Hey, that's cheating!", than you probably shouldn't be writing HTML in the first place.

# Commits

If you're literate in Git and HTML and want to help out then you can go ahead and fork it and send a pull request. If it looks halfway decent, I'll merge it. A commit should't have to be Shakespeare, just a few words describing what you did. (Note also, forking this for your own website would be really helpful if you're in my school district)
